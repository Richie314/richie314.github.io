## Site under construcion!

Hello world, my name is Riccardo.

I am a computer engineering student at the
[University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it) and honorous student at
[Sant'Anna School of Advanced studies](https://santannapisa.it).

I come from Livorno but i currently live in Pisa.

I'm an open source enthusiast and have a lot of hobbies.
I'm a great ASP.NET and PHP fan, but I also work with IoT platforms (ESP, Arduino) and containers (both Docker and Podman). I've also worked with C and basic Linux development.

## Cybersecurity

During the first year of university I approached cybersecurity and the CTF world. I am a member of the
[BeautifulSSSUP](https://github.com/BeautifulSSSUP) team.

## Sport

I practiced Triple jump and Long jump for many years before starting university. Despite not competing anymore I remain a huge Track and Field enjoyer.

My best results can be found on [Atletica.me](https://atletica.me/atleta/Riccardo-Ciucci/335769)

## Hobbies

As every engineer, I grew up playing with LEGO and, to this day as an adult, I can proudly say I'm still a fan.
