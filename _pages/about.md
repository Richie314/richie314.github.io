Hello world, my name is Riccardo.

I come from Livorno and am now a computer engineering student at the
[University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it) and honorous student at
[Sant'Anna School of Advanced studies](https://santannapisa.it), where I currenctly live.

My primary expertise includes PHP, Docker, JavaScript, Python, ASP.NET Core, and C#, but I have also worked extensively with Podman, C/C++, Linux, and IoT boards such as Arduinos and ESPs.

Open source material was a great pillar of my learning years in programming, and, as of that,
I strongly believe now in Open Source development and keep all my repositories public on GitHub.

## Cybersecurity

During the first year of university I approached cybersecurity and the CTF world. I am a member of the
[BeautifulSSSUP](https://github.com/BeautifulSSSUP) team.

At my first real CTF, my team (University of Pisa) ranked third nationwide.
My primary skills involve around web-based challenges, reverse engineering and also Osint but am looking forward to master new areas.

### Sport

I practiced Triple jump and Long jump for many years before starting university. Despite not competing anymore I remain a huge Track and Field enjoyer.

My best results can be found on [Atletica.me](https://atletica.me/atleta/Riccardo-Ciucci/335769)

### Hobbies

As every engineer, I grew up playing with LEGO and, to this day as an adult, I can proudly say I'm still a fan.
